## API Usage

**Note:** Before moving ahead make sure you have created the `,env` file in the `api` folder and install the `mongodb` from official site [Visit MONGODB](https://www.mongodb.com) then paste this in `.env` file

        PORT=8090
        MONGO_URI="mongodb://0.0.0.0:27017/scholarhip"
        JWT_SECRET_KEY=""

`add the jwt secret key`

also create a `.env` file in `client` directory and paste this in it and replace the `PORT` with the value shown on the terminal when you run the server

        VITE_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:[PORT]/api"

in case you want to create online database then get the free or paid version from the mongodb site

1. **Navigate to api directory**
